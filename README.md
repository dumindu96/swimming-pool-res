## Project Scope

The user has a swimming pool which is too hard to manage via a single person. Normally user has to store data on swimming pool bookings, user registered details to check whether he is a regular customer or not and as well as pool calendar to store swimming pool sessions or sometimes bookings also. Pool bookings can be happened in two ways. One is online (but at this moment customers will use phone calls to book pool) and other is come to the pool and book.

So the user requires a web based computer system to manage pool bookings as well as manage user details. There should be pool calendar to store booking and as well as some usual pool sessions. And there should be an admin panel to manage pool calendar, generate some analytical reports  and user details. As well as a third party payment gateway for online payments to be handled.
